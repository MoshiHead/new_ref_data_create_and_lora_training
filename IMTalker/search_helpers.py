"""search_helpers.py — query routing, web search, context compression, and the
isolated upstream-`moshi` STT loader for the live IMTalker avatar pipeline
(`liveTryHeliumFrontendDequeStaticPoseFP32FM_ws_binary_AHAudioPace.py`).

This replaces the former `rag_helpers.py`. The local-document RAG path (FAISS
index, sentence-transformers embeddings, hierarchical chunk retrieval) has been
removed entirely. The pipeline is now:

    user speech -> STT transcript -> QueryRouter decision

        |                          own knowledge (no injection)
        |
        +-- needs_search == True -> web search -> clean -> compress
                                      -> inject <ref> ... <ref>

Everything here is intentionally free of any dependency on the PersonaPlex
`moshi` fork, `lm_gen`, or CUDA-graph state — these are pure decision/
retrieval/compression/HTTP helpers plus one namespaced import shim, safe to
call from a background thread. The only GPU-touching classes are
`ContextCompressor` and `QueryRouter`, which share one small model and never
touch the main PersonaPlex LM.

# ── Tier 0: instant rule-based routing ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# Four ordered layers, pure regex, microseconds. They run inline on the GPU
# thread so the common shapes never pay for a model forward pass, and -- more
# importantly -- so the common shapes are decided DETERMINISTICALLY instead of
# being left to a 1.5B model's judgement.
#
# The ordering is the whole design. Earlier layers win:
#
#   1 EXPLICIT_TIME   an explicit time reference ("today", "right now", "2026")
#                     -> SEARCH. A time word is the strongest possible signal
#                     and must beat everything below it, so "what is the gold
#                     price today" searches even though "what is" looks static.
#   2 STATIC_FORM     the question's SHAPE is conceptual, procedural or
#                     advisory -> NO SEARCH, whatever the topic.
#   3 LIVE_TOPIC      asks for a value or event that is inherently live
#                     (a price, the weather, a score) -> SEARCH.
#   4 CHITCHAT        greetings, thanks, references to the conversation itself
#                     -> NO SEARCH.
#
# Layer 2 sits ABOVE layer 3 on purpose, and that is the fix for the misroutes
# in conversation_log_2. "How I can invest in cryptocurrency?" and "Is it safe
# to invest in cryptocurrency?" are finance questions -- topic words like
# invest/crypto/market pull hard towards "live data" -- but their SHAPE is
# procedural and advisory, and shape is what actually determines whether a
# lookup is needed. Judge the question type, not its subject.
